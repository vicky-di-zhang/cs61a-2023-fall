  👍🏼Actually the “Recording” videos are very useful, luckily I found some Videos of Q&A part from 2020 fall (highly recommended to watch all of Q&A in this list): [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1s3411G7yM/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=8dcf087f62ffdb64351118000a13f13e]](url)
  
  🙏🏼If you get stuck doing DISC part, the tutorial videos may be helpful (Videos starting with "Disc" in the list / similar Disc part from 2023 spring): [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV138411F7vT?p=133&vd_source=8dcf087f62ffdb64351118000a13f13e](url)

# cs61a Fall 2023 --- Self-Study Project
- **This project encompasses the exercise that I completed when I was self-studying the CS61a 2023fall course at Berkeley University. **




- **My Self-Study Journey of cs61a Fall 2023:**
  - I started self-study of this course on January 20, 2024, and I completed all the course and Lab/hw/projects exercises except scheme-related part on February 20, 2024.
  - I think cs61a is a very good basic CS course. Its teaching videos and lectures of Q&A part are very good, but the most amazing part of this course is its various exercises. The questions are very well designed, which makes me have a deeper understanding of the content of the lecture. I also like projects. Especially ANTS. After finishing the code, I played ANTS all night. ANTS gave me my first taste of the fun of programming.

Thanks to the official website of the University of Berkeley for providing the course structure, videos and corresponding exercises. And John DeNero and Hany Farid are the best!

    - 🦾Videos of the last several lectures 2023 fall (if you cannot find some videos on the official website): [https://www.youtube.com/@JohnDeNero/playlists](url)
    - 👍🏼Actually the “Recording” videos are very useful, luckily I found some Videos of Q&A part from 2020 fall (highly recommended to watch all of Q&A in this list): [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1s3411G7yM/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=8dcf087f62ffdb64351118000a13f13e]](url)
    - 🙏🏼If you get stuck doing DISC part, the tutorial videos may be helpful (Videos starting with "Disc" in the list / similar Disc part from 2023 spring): [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV138411F7vT?p=133&vd_source=8dcf087f62ffdb64351118000a13f13e](url)


- **Additional information:**
  - Since the purpose of my study is work- and application-oriented rather than academic and theoretical. Therefore I skipped all scheme-related lessons and exercises.
  - Because hw06 requires a password to unlock, I used the spring 2023 version of hw06 and hw07 instead.
  - If you want to run or verify doctest, you can enter this command in the terminal:  python -m doctest name_of_your_file.py
